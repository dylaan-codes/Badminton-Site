# 🏸 End Badminton  

**End Badminton** is a web application I developed as a graduate project, aimed at badminton enthusiasts who want a simple and intuitive platform to book lessons and improve their game.  

## 💻 Technologies Used  
- **HTML**: 🧱 Structured the content and layout of the website.  
- **CSS**: 🎨 Designed a responsive and visually appealing interface, focusing on modern design principles.  
- **JavaScript**: ⚙️ Implemented interactive elements and enhanced user experience through dynamic features.  

## 🎯 Design Philosophy  
I applied my own take on **UI and UX design** to create a platform that's not only functional but also user-friendly and engaging. From smooth navigation to a clean booking interface, the goal was to balance aesthetics with usability.  

Feel free to explore the site and see how thoughtful design and coding practices come together in **End Badminton**.
